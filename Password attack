Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, programs and all data from digital attacks. 
These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.
Here, Password Attacks are one of the most common forms of corporate and personal data breach. 
A password attack is simply when a hacker tries to steal your password. 
But the truth is that you can prevent a lot of common attacks and keep your online accounts safer just by using better passwords. 
So if you are looking for a way to improve your cybersecurity, password security is where you should start.
